# html-portfolio
This repository is dedicated to my personal portfolio website, which is crafted purely with HTML. Its primary purpose is to provide an online version of my CV, alongside my contact information for professional inquiries. The website serves as a digital business card, offering a brief introduction to who I am and how to reach me.
